# cubing.spec

A spec-driven CFOP learning companion for Rubik's cube speedsolving. Built to support my journey from beginner method to sub-2-minute solves using the CFOP method.

**Live app:** https://andyjudson.github.io/cubing.spec/

## What is this?

This project serves as a personal reference for learning and practicing CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) — the dominant speedcubing method used in competitive solving. The app provides algorithm grids, interactive visualizations, practice timers, and solve tracking to make learning efficient and fun.

Development follows a specification-first approach using **spec-kit** principles, with AI-assisted implementation via **GitHub Copilot agent mode**.

## Motivation

I first learned to solve a cube using the beginner method from [JPerm](https://www.youtube.com/@JPerm) (Dylan Wang) and progressed to CFOP through tutorials from [CubeHead](https://www.youtube.com/@CubeHead) (Milan Struyf). This app helps consolidate that learning with quick visual references and practice tools. I'm not a cubing expert — just a beginner aiming for consistent sub-2-minute solves while experimenting with modern web development workflows.

## CFOP Primer

CFOP is a four-step 3x3 speedcubing method developed around 1981 and is responsible for most [world record](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/records?event_id=333&show=mixed+history) times over the last decade (sub-5 seconds is wild! 🤯).

- **Cross** - Solve four edge pieces on the bottom face (intuitive)
- **F2L** (First Two Layers) - Insert edge-corner pairs into four slots (intuitive, 4 core cases)
- **OLL** (Orientation of Last Layer) - Orient last layer pieces (algorithmic, 9 cases for 2-look)
- **PLL** (Permutation of Last Layer) - Position last layer pieces (algorithmic, 6 cases for 2-look)

Start with the essential four algorithms (Sune, AntiSune, T-Perm, Ua-Perm), then gradually expand to the full 2-look suite for better efficiency.

### Algorithm coverage (full sets)

- **Beginner 2-look set (current learning grid):** 16 cases total (10 OLL + 6 PLL)
- **F2L (full):** 41 cases
- **OLL (full):** 57 cases
- **PLL (full):** 21 cases

## Practice Strategies

Repetition is the key theme: consistent reps build recognition and muscle memory.

### Solve with algorithms in mind

- Practice with focused weekly goals (for example: improve one F2L case set or PLL recognition).
- Start slow for accuracy and finger placement, then increase speed gradually.
- Repeat each algorithm 10-20 times in one session to build muscle memory.
- Observe piece movement during execution to strengthen visual + logical understanding.
- Work on efficient finger tricks and reduce unnecessary cube rotations.
- If you make a mistake, re-scramble and repeat the same case with cleaner execution.

### Solve with random scrambles

- Scramble randomly and practice one stage at a time (Cross, F2L, OLL, or PLL).
- Set measurable targets (for example: Cross under 8 moves, F2L under 30 seconds).
- Use a timer for algorithms and full solves to track progress over time.
