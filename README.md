# cubing.spec

This project serves as a personal reference for learning and practicing CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) — the dominant speedcubing method used in competitive solving. Development follows a specification-first approach using **spec-kit** principles, with AI-assisted implementation via **GitHub Copilot agent mode**.

## Applications

### cfop-app
CFOP learning companion with algorithm reference grids, interactive visualizations, practice timers, and solve tracking.

**Live app:** https://andyjudson.github.io/cubing.spec/

**Features:**
- Full CFOP navigation (Intuitive, Notation, Beginner/2LK, F2L, OLL, PLL)
- Notation reference page covering face turns, modifiers, slices, rotations, and common triggers
- Expandable/collapsible algorithm sections with session persistence
- Interactive tooltips with algorithm notes (2LK page only)
- Solve visualization modal with cubing.js TwistyPlayer (2LK page only)
- Practice timer with fallback scramble generator (2LK page only)
- Persistent solve time tracking via localStorage
- OLL consolidated from 14→7 balanced groups for improved scanability

**Directory:** `/cfop-app/` • [README](cfop-app/README.md)

### cubify-app
Standalone cube image generator for use in algorithm documentation with 3D PNG and 2D SVG export capabilities.

**Usage:** Local development tool (not deployed to GitHub Pages)

**Features:**
- 3D PNG capture at native resolution (~4096×4096)
- 2D SVG export with 288×288 viewBox
- Preset mask library for CFOP stages (default, cross, F2L, OLL, PLL)
- Custom mask override with orbit notation
- Setup algorithm configuration with anchor control
- Algorithm validation and inversion logging

## Motivation

I first learned to solve a cube using the beginner method from [JPerm](https://www.youtube.com/@JPerm) (Dylan Wang) and progressed to CFOP through tutorials from [CubeHead](https://www.youtube.com/@CubeHead) (Milan Struyf). This app helps consolidate that learning with quick visual references and practice tools. I'm not a cubing expert — just a beginner aiming for consistent sub-2-minute solves while experimenting with modern web development workflows.

## CFOP Primer

CFOP is a four-step 3x3 speedcubing method developed around 1981 and is responsible for most [world record](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/records?event_id=333&show=mixed+history) times over the last decade (sub-5 seconds is wild! 🤯).

- **Cross** - Solve four edge pieces on the bottom face, typically white (intuitive)
- **F2L** (First Two Layers) - Insert edge-corner pairs into four slots (intuitive or algorithmic). There are 41 algorithmic cases in total, or 4 if using the intuitive method.
- **OLL** (Orientation of Last Layer) - Orient last layer pieces (algorithmic). There are 57 cases in total (organized in 7 balanced groups), or 10 if using the 2-look method.
- **PLL** (Permutation of Last Layer) - Position last layer pieces (algorithmic). There are 21 cases in total (organized in 5 groups), or 6 if using the 2-look method.

Start with the essential four algorithms (Sune, AntiSune, T-Perm, Ua-Perm), then gradually expand to the full 2-look methods for better efficiency.

## Practice Strategies

Repetition is the key theme: consistent reps build recognition and muscle memory.

### Solve with algorithms in mind

- Practice with focused weekly goals (for example: improve one F2L case set or PLL recognition).
- Start slow for accuracy and finger placement, then increase speed gradually.
- Repeat each algorithm 10-20 times in one session to build muscle memory.
- Observe piece movement during execution to strengthen visual + logical understanding.
- Work on efficient finger tricks and reduce unnecessary cube rotations.
- If you make a mistake, re-scramble and repeat the same case with cleaner execution.

### Solve with random scrambles

- Scramble randomly and practice one stage at a time (Cross, F2L, OLL, or PLL).
- Set measurable targets (for example: Cross under 8 moves, F2L under 30 seconds).
- Use a timer for algorithms and full solves to track progress over time.
