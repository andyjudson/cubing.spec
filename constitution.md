# Cubing App Constitution

## Project Principles

### Educational Focus
This application exists to help users (namely me) learn Rubik's cube solving methods, specifically the CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) system. All features must support this educational goal.

### Open Source & Accessibility
- Code should be open source and freely available
- Content should be accessible to users worldwide
- No paywalls or premium features that restrict learning

### Technical Excellence
- Use modern, maintainable web technologies
- Prioritize performance and user experience
- Follow web standards and best practices
- Consider cross-platform compatibility but essentially macOS and iOS

## Constraints & Boundaries

### Content Ownership
- Content based on publicly available CFOP methods
- Avoid direct copying of proprietary tutorial content
- Respect copyright of external educational materials
- Keep implementation private to avoid commercial conflicts

### Technology Choices
- Web-first approach with React ecosystem (React 19+, TypeScript, Vite)
- Mobile deployment via Capacitor or PWA (no native iOS licensing)
- Cubing.js for cube visualizations (maintained library on github)
- Algorithm sets should be maintained in JSON (shared via symlinks)
- Prefer lite or minimalist frameworks (Bulma CSS for base layout)
- Minimal dependencies to ensure long-term maintainability
- Shared resources pattern: symlink from `shared-data/` and `shared-assets/`

### Scope Limitations
- Focus exclusively on CFOP method learning (intuitive + 3-look, 2-look, 1-look levels)
- Limited tracking features, at most a scramble generator and timer for personal use so can stay in one app
- No social or competitive features or user accounts
- No monetization or advertising

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- Comprehensive testing (unit + e2e)
- Clean, documented code following React best practices
- Regular dependency updates and security reviews

### User Experience
- Intuitive navigation and information hierarchy
- Fast loading and responsive interactions
- Accessible design for all users
- Consistent visual design across platforms

### Performance Requirements
- Fast initial load times
- Smooth cube animations and interactions
- Efficient data structures and rendering
- Minimal bundle size for web deployment

## Development Guidelines

### Specification Workflow (Hybrid Model)
- Keep `spec.md` as the high-level product narrative, status ledger, and feature sequence source of truth.
- Create one per-feature folder under `specs/<NNN>-<kebab-name>/` for every new feature from now on.
- For each feature folder, include at minimum:
	- `spec.md`
	- `checklists/requirements.md`
	- `implementation-summary.md` (once implemented)
- Keep numbering contiguous and aligned with the feature numbering in `spec.md`.
- If historical features are missing folders, backfill them as retrospective artifacts and label them clearly as retrospective.
- Prefer this hybrid pattern over either extreme (single monolithic spec only, or disconnected per-feature docs only).

### Maintenance & Refactor Workflow
- Treat cross-cutting cleanup (styling consistency, component reuse, deduplication, architecture hardening) as maintenance work, not feature delivery, unless it introduces new end-user functionality.
- Before starting maintenance, add a short scope note in planning artifacts (target area, acceptance criteria, and constraints) so changes are auditable.
- After completion, update implementation notes/instructions with the final standards that were actually implemented.
- Keep maintenance commits focused and incremental (small batches with validation between batches).

### Architecture Decisions
- Component-based React architecture
- State management via React hooks
- Local storage for user data persistence
- CDN delivery for external dependencies

### Deployment Strategy
- Web deployment as primary platform (e.g. running locally)
- Mobile apps via Capacitor or PWA for enhanced experience
- No server-side requirements (static hosting)
- Offline-capable for algorithm reference when traveling

### Maintenance Approach
- Regular framework and dependency updates
- Backward compatibility for user data
- Documentation of architectural decisions via spec.md (feature-based numbering)
- Clear separation of concerns in codebase
- Iterative development: spec → implement → refine → document
