# Feature Specification: Random Scramble and Solve Timer

**Feature Branch**: `[004-add-scramble-timer]`  
**Created**: 2026-03-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a button to show another modal dialog, generate a random scramble, and display a simple timer to measure solve time". 

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Generate a Practice Scramble (Priority: P1)

As a learner preparing for a solve, I want to generate a random scramble with one action so I can start practice immediately without leaving the page.

**Why this priority**: A scramble is the starting point of every timed solve. Without it, the timing workflow has no practical value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the page and selecting the scramble action repeatedly, confirming that each action returns a readable scramble string suitable for cube setup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on the practice page, **When** the user activates the random scramble button, **Then** a new scramble is shown immediately.
2. **Given** a scramble is already visible, **When** the user activates the random scramble button again, **Then** the shown scramble is replaced with a different newly generated scramble.
3. **Given** a scramble is displayed, **When** the user has not requested a new one, **Then** the scramble remains visible and unchanged.

### User Story 2 - Time a Solve (Priority: P2)

As a learner doing a solve, I want a simple timer that I can start and stop so I can measure my solve duration.

**Why this priority**: Solve timing is the core feedback loop for practice progress and must work reliably once a scramble exists.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the timer, waiting a short period, stopping it, and confirming the elapsed time is displayed and greater than zero.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the timer is idle, **When** the user starts the timer, **Then** elapsed time begins increasing visibly.
2. **Given** the timer is running, **When** the user stops the timer, **Then** elapsed time stops changing and the final solve time remains visible.
3. **Given** a solve time is displayed, **When** the user starts a new timing attempt, **Then** the timer starts from zero for the new attempt.

### User Story 3 - Smooth Practice Flow (Priority: P3)

As a learner completing repeated solves, I want scramble generation and timing to work together clearly so I can run multiple practice attempts without confusion.

**Why this priority**: A smooth loop improves usability and encourages repeated use, but it depends on core scramble and timer behavior.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing a sequence of attempts (generate scramble → solve with timer → generate next scramble) and confirming clear state transitions each cycle.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a solve has been timed, **When** the user requests a new scramble, **Then** the next attempt can begin without stale timer state carrying over unexpectedly.
2. **Given** the timer is running, **When** the user triggers an action that would disrupt timing (such as requesting a new scramble), **Then** the system handles the interaction predictably and communicates the resulting timer state.

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- User activates start/stop in rapid succession; the timer state remains consistent and no duplicate running timers occur.
- User requests a new scramble while the timer is running; the resulting behavior is explicit and consistent with documented timer rules.
- User leaves the page and returns during or after timing; the interface does not present misleading running time.
- Generated scramble contains malformed notation; the system must prevent display of invalid scramble text.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a visible control that lets the user generate a random scramble on demand.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST display the generated scramble in standard cube move notation that is readable and copyable.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST replace the currently displayed scramble with a newly generated scramble each time the user requests one.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide a simple timer that supports three states: idle, running, and stopped.
- **FR-005**: The user MUST be able to start timing from the idle state and see elapsed solve time update while running.
- **FR-006**: The user MUST be able to stop timing from the running state and see a final solve time value.
- **FR-007**: The user MUST be able to begin a new timing attempt after stopping, with elapsed time reset to zero at the start of the new attempt.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST prevent conflicting timer actions so that only one active timing session can exist at a time.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST define and enforce a consistent behavior when a new scramble is requested during an active timing session.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST keep scramble and timer controls understandable for first-time users without requiring documentation.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Scramble**: A generated sequence of valid cube moves shown to the user for one solve attempt.
- **Timer Session**: A single solve timing instance with state (`idle`, `running`, `stopped`), start time reference, elapsed time, and final recorded solve time.
- **Practice Attempt**: A user attempt that links one displayed scramble and one timer session outcome.

### Assumptions

- The feature is intended for individual practice sessions and does not require account creation or cross-device sync.
- Only one timer is needed on the page at a time.
- Solve history storage is out of scope for this feature; only the current attempt result must be shown.
- Standard web accessibility and readability expectations apply to controls and displayed values.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of users can generate a new scramble within 3 seconds of arriving on the page, without assistance.
- **SC-002**: 95% of users can complete one full timing cycle (start, stop, and view final time) on their first attempt.
- **SC-003**: In usability checks, at least 90% of users correctly understand timer state (idle, running, stopped) at any moment.
- **SC-004**: During repeated practice testing (20 consecutive attempts), zero ambiguous or contradictory timer states are observed.
